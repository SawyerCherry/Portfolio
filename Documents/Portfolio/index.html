                            <h3>About Me:</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>I am from both Kentucky and Tennessee, right on the border line counties. My Dad lives in Tennessee about 25 mins from my Moms in Kentucky. I spend my days as a Poultry Farmer for Tyson, In fact, My dad, my Uncle, and my Grandparents all farm Chickens for Tyson, so there's always plenty to do on the farm. I'm now working towards a degree in computer science, get a decent job and save for my own farm one day. I like simple sayings like this, "No farm, no food."</p>
